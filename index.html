            Our product, Fashion Generator, can help ensure that regardless of where you are and where you go,<br>
            you will always be able to find an outfit that suits the demands of the climate of your environment<br>
            - current or future.

            Through the use of the WeatherAPI, we have given users the ability to search for the next week's forecast<br>
            based on either their current location or the city they are traveling to. Using this same data, we find<br>
            clothes that best suit the forecast of that week and generate an outfit that would best suit this weather.<br>
            The user then receives a list of clothing items we would recommend, a DALL-E generated image of an outfit<br>
            using some of the clothing items we recommended, and SerAPI search results so that the user would know where<br>
            they could purchase the recommended items.

            We have also added the ability for users to make an account so they can save their favorite outfit and item<br>
            recommendations, in case they forget!
